## üöÄ Live Demo

- **Production**: [https://react-19-crud-example-467321.uc.r.appspot.com](https://react-19-crud-example-467321.uc.r.appspot.com)
- **Local Docker**: `http://localhost:8080` (or auto-detected port)

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Google Cloud CLI** (for GCP deployment)

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PacoCastle/react-19-crud-example.git
cd react-19-crud-example

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run with automatic port conflict resolution
./deploy-docker.ps1

# Manual Docker build
docker build -t react-19-crud .
docker run -p 8080:8080 react-19-crud
```

### Google Cloud Platform
```bash
# Deploy to App Engine
gcloud app deploy

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy react-19-crud --source .

# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
